## Known issues outside of our code:

- When opening the accordion, there is an error, "Warning: findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode. findDOMNode was passed an instance of Transition which is inside StrictMode." This is a known issue with react-bootstrap: https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap/issues/5075.
